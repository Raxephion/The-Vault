# 🏦 The-Vault: Generative AI Workflow Tools

Welcome to **The-Vault**! This repository is a growing collection of Python scripts and tools designed to aid and assist with generative (Creative AI) workflows, particularly focusing on image generation, model/LoRA inspection, and model management.

These tools are developed to be simple, effective, and are available **free for personal use**. My aim is to provide practical utilities that can help enthusiasts, artists, and developers streamline their creative AI processes.

This is an **ongoing project**, and I will be adding more tools and refining existing ones as I develop them. Your feedback and suggestions are welcome!

### 🚀 Getting Started

You don’t need to clone the whole Vault — unless you want to.

Each tool lives in its own folder and comes with its own README, usage instructions, and (where applicable) dependencies. Just browse to the tool you need and follow the instructions there.

If you do want to download the whole thing:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/The-Vault.git
cd The-Vault
```

### 📦 Dependencies

Most tools rely on commonly used libraries in the generative AI ecosystem. If you're unsure what you need, this basic install will cover 90% of use cases:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio safetensors diffusers transformers accelerate huggingface_hub
```

Check each tool’s folder or README for any additional or optional dependencies.

### 🔮 Future Plans

This vault is just getting started. Planned additions include:

- Advanced model and LoRA analysis tools.
- Batch processing utilities for repetitive tasks.
- Helpers for dataset preparation and augmentation.
- Scripts for comparing model outputs or embeddings.
- User-friendly wrappers using `argparse` to replace hardcoded configs.

Got an idea? Open an issue and let me know!
