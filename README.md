# üè¶ The-Vault: Generative AI Workflow Tools

Welcome to **The-Vault**! This repository is a growing collection of Python scripts and tools designed to aid and assist with generative (Creative AI) workflows, particularly focusing on image generation, model/LoRA inspection, and model management.

These tools are developed to be simple, effective, and are available **free for personal use**. My aim is to provide practical utilities that can help enthusiasts, artists, and developers streamline their creative AI processes.

This is an **ongoing project**, and I will be adding more tools and refining existing ones as I develop them. Your feedback and suggestions are welcome!

üåü What's Inside?

The-Vault currently contains:

- **HubShuttle**: A simple script to upload your Hugging Face Diffusers models to the Hugging Face Hub in one command. Handles repo creation, file upload, ignore patterns, and optional privacy ‚Äî no coding required.


Below is a breakdown of the tools available:

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Current Tools

#### 1. HubShuttle (`hubshuttle.py`)
   * **What it does:** Uploads a local Hugging Face Diffusers model to the Hugging Face Hub in one go.
   * **How it works:**
     1. Accepts arguments like your model directory, repo name, username, and commit message via command line.
     2. Creates a new repo on Hugging Face Hub (or reuses one if it already exists).
     3. Uploads your model files with optional ignore patterns and privacy settings.
   * **Use Case:** Great for creators who want to share or back up their models without messing around with git or the web UI ‚Äî just run the script and you're done.

### üöÄ Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/The-Vault.git
    cd The-Vault
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Most scripts rely on common libraries in the generative AI space. Ensure you have them installed, typically:
    ```bash
    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio safetensors diffusers transformers accelerate huggingface_hub
    ```
    *Note: A `requirements.txt` file may be added in the future for easier dependency management.*

3.  **Using the Tools:**
    *   Navigate to the directory containing the script you want to use.
    *   **Important:** Most scripts currently have hardcoded file paths (e.g., `lora_path`, `checkpoint_path`, `output_directory`, `model_directory`) and configuration (e.g., `your_username`, `repo_name`). You will need to **open the Python script and modify these parameters** to point to your local files and set your configurations.
    *   **For Hugging Face Uploads:** Ensure you are logged in to Hugging Face. If you haven't already, run `huggingface-cli login` in your terminal and follow the prompts.
    *   Run the script from your terminal:
        ```bash
        python script_name.py
        ```
    *   Follow any on-screen prompts or observe the output.

### üîÆ Future Plans

This vault is far from full! I plan to add more tools, including but not limited to:

*   More advanced model and LoRA analysis tools.
*   Batch processing utilities for common tasks.
*   Helpers for dataset preparation or augmentation.
*   Scripts for comparing model outputs or embeddings.
*   User-friendly interfaces or wrappers for existing CLI tools (e.g., using `argparse` for command-line arguments instead of hardcoded paths).

Your suggestions for new tools are highly encouraged! Feel free to open an issue to suggest a new feature or tool.

### ü§ù Contributing (Suggestions & Feedback)

While this is primarily a personal project, I'm open to suggestions, feedback, and identifying bugs. Please feel free to:

*   **Open an Issue:** If you find a bug, have a feature request, or a suggestion for a new tool.
*   **Provide Feedback:** Let me know if these tools are helpful for your workflows!

### üìú License

The tools in this repository are provided **free for personal use**.

Please note: While the scripts are provided for personal use, the underlying libraries (`torch`, `diffusers`, `safetensors`, `huggingface_hub`, etc.) are subject to their own licenses.
